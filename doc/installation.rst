Installation
============

The preferred method for installing this package is to use a binary release distributed with a package manager.
If your preferred package manager is not available, you can also download the source code and build it yourself.


Installing from conda
---------------------

This project is packaged for the *conda* package manager and available on the *conda-forge* channel.
To install the *conda* package manager we recommend the `miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases>`_ installer.
If the *conda-forge* channel is not yet enabled, add it to your channels with

.. code-block:: bash

    conda config --add channels conda-forge

Once the *conda-forge* channel has been enabled, this project can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install simple-dftd3

If you want to enable the Python API as well install

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install dftd3-python

It is possible to list all of the versions available on your platform with:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda search simple-dftd3 --channel conda-forge

Now you are ready to use the ``s-dftd3`` executable, find the ``dftd3.h`` header or import ``dftd3`` in your Python projects.


Building from source
--------------------

This library depends on few Fortran modules to provide the desired functionality

- `mctc-lib`_: Modular computation tool chain library
- `mstore`_: Molecular structure store (testing only)

.. _meson-build:

Meson based build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary build system of this project is `meson`_.
For the full feature-complete build it is highly recommended to perform the build and development with meson.
To setup a build the following software is required

- A Fortran 2008 compliant compiler, like GCC Fortran and Intel Fortran classic
- `meson`_, version 0.55 or newer
- `ninja`_, version 1.7 or newer

Optional dependencies are

- `asciidoctor`_, to build the manual pages
- A C compiler to test the C API and compile the Python extension module
- Python 3.6 or newer with the `CFFI`_ package installed to build the Python API

To setup a new build run

.. code:: text

   meson setup _build --prefix=$HOME/.local

The Fortran and C compiler can be selected with the ``FC`` and ``CC`` environment variable, respectively.
The installation location is selected using the ``--prefix`` option.
The required Fortran modules will be fetched automatically from the upstream repositories and checked out in the *subprojects* directory.


.. tip::

   To produce statically linked binaries set ``--default-library=static`` and add ``-Dfortran_link_args=-static`` as well.

To compile the project run

.. code:: text

   meson compile -C _build

Verify that the resulting projects is working correctly by running the testsuite with

.. code:: text

   meson test -C _build --print-errorlogs

In case meson is spawning too many concurrent test jobs limit the number of processes with the ``--num-processes`` option when running the test command.
By default the whole library and its subprojects are tested, to limit the testing to the project itself add ``--suite s-dftd3`` as option.

To verify the included parametrizations are working correctly run the extra testsuite by passing the ``--benchmark`` argument

.. code:: text

   meson test -C _build --print-errorlogs --benchmark

Finally, you can make the project available by installation with

.. code:: text

   meson install -C _build


CMake based build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project also provides support for `CMake`_ to give projects using it as build system an easier way to interface.
The CMake build files usually do not provide a feature-complete build, but contributions are more than welcome.
To setup a build the following software is required

- A Fortran 2008 compliant compiler, like GCC Fortran and Intel Fortran classic
- `cmake`_, version 3.14 or newer
- `ninja`_, version 1.10 or newer

Configure a new build with

.. code:: text

   cmake -B _build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local

You can set the Fortran compiler in the ``FC`` environment variable.
The installation location can be selected with the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, GNU install directories are supported by default.
CMake will automatically fetch the required Fortran modules, you can provide specific version in the *subprojects* directory which will be used instead.

To run a build use

.. code:: text

   cmake --build _build

After a successful build make sure the testsuite passes

.. code:: text

   pushd _build && ctest --output-on-failure && popd

To make the project available install it with

.. code:: text

   cmake --install _build


Fpm based build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This projects supports building with the Fortran package manager (`fpm`_).
Create a new build by running

.. code:: text

   fpm build

You can adjust the Fortran compiler with the ``--compiler`` option and select the compilation profile with ``--profile release``.
To test the resulting build run the testsuite with

.. code:: text

   fpm test

The command line driver can be directly used from fpm wih

.. code:: text

   fpm run --profile release -- --help

To make the installation accessible install the project with

.. code:: text

   fpm install --profile release --prefix $HOME/.local


.. _python-build:

Python extension module
-----------------------

The Python API is available as Python extension module.
The easiest way to setup is to add ``-Dpython=true`` to a meson tree build and follow the :ref:`meson installation instructions <meson-build>`.
The extension module will become available once the project is installed.

This section describes alternative ways to build the Python API


Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

This project support installation with pip as an easy way to build the Python API.

- C compiler to build the C-API and compile the extension module (the compiler name should be exported in the ``CC`` environment variable)
- Python 3.6 or newer
- The following Python packages are required additionally

  - `cffi`_
  - `numpy`_
  - `pkgconfig`_ (setup only)

Make sure to have your C compiler set to the ``CC`` environment variable

.. code:: sh

   export CC=gcc

Install the project with pip

.. code:: sh

   pip install .

To install extra dependencies as well use

.. code:: sh

   pip install '.[ase]'


Using meson
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python extension module can be built on-top of an existing installation, either provided by meson or CMake.

Building requires against an existing *s-dftd3* installation requires

- C compiler to build the C-API and compile the extension module
- `meson`_ version 0.55 or newer
- a build-system backend, *i.e.* `ninja`_ version 1.7 or newer
- Python 3.6 or newer with the `CFFI`_ package installed

Setup a build with

.. code:: sh

   meson setup _build_python python -Dpython_version=3

The Python version can be used to select a different Python version, it defaults to ``'3'``.
Python 2 is not supported with this project, the Python version key is meant to select between several local Python 3 versions.

Compile the project with

.. code:: sh

   meson compile -C _build

The extension module is now available in ``_build_python/dftd3/_libdftd3.*.so``.
You can install as usual with

.. code:: sh

   meson configure _build --prefix=/path/to/install
   meson install -C _build
