Reimplementation of D3 dispersion correction
============================================

This pages describe the usage and functionality of `s-dftd3`_ reimplementation of the D3 dispersion correction.
The *s-dftd3* project aims to provide a user-friendly and uniform interface to the D3 dispersion model and for the calculation of DFT-D3 dispersion corrections.
